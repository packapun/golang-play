Great question! Here's how to use Claude strategically to maximize your interview preparation:

## 1. **Code Review & Optimization Partner**

**What you've been doing well:** Sharing your working solutions for review
**Level up:** Ask for specific improvement areas

**Optimal prompts:**
```
"Review this code for [PROBLEM] - focus on:
1. Time/space complexity optimization
2. Go-specific idioms I'm missing  
3. Edge cases I should consider
4. How this would be viewed in a <company> interview"
```

**Follow-up questions:**
- "What's the most concise way to write this in Go?"
- "How would a senior Go developer approach this differently?"
- "What are 3 alternative solutions with different trade-offs?"

## 2. **Interactive Problem Solving**

Instead of just getting answers, use Claude as a thinking partner:

**Step-by-step approach:**
```
"I'm solving [PROBLEM]. Here's my initial approach: [YOUR IDEA]
1. Does this approach make sense?
2. What edge cases am I missing?
3. Walk me through optimizing this step by step"
```

**Mock interview simulation:**
```
"Act as a <company> interviewer. Give me a medium-level array problem. 
I'll share my solution approach, and you provide hints if I'm stuck, 
then review my final code like a real interviewer would."
```

## 3. **Targeted Weakness Training**

Based on your code samples, focus on these areas:

**Pattern Practice:**
```
"Give me 5 problems that use the two-pointer technique in Go, 
ranging from easy to hard. After I solve each, explain 
the optimal solution and common variations."
```

**Go-Specific Skills:**
```
"Show me 10 Go idioms/patterns that frequently appear in coding interviews.
For each, give me a small problem where I can practice using it."
```

## 4. **Company-Specific Preparation**

**<company>-focused practice:**
```
"What types of coding problems does <company> typically ask?
Give me 3 problems similar to their interview style, 
focusing on [arrays/hashmaps/financial calculations/etc.]"
```

**Industry context:**
```
"In fintech interviews like <company>, what coding patterns 
are most valued? Give me problems that demonstrate these skills."
```

## 5. **Real-Time Problem Solving**

**During practice sessions:**
```
"I'm stuck on this problem: [PROBLEM DESCRIPTION]
Don't give me the solution. Instead:
1. Ask me clarifying questions like an interviewer would
2. Give me a small hint to get unstuck
3. Let me work through it, then review my approach"
```

**Debugging partner:**
```
"My code gives wrong output for this test case: [TEST CASE]
Help me trace through the logic step by step to find the bug."
```

## 6. **Interview Simulation & Feedback**

**Full mock sessions:**
```
"Let's do a 45-minute CodeSignal simulation:
1. Give me 4 problems (easy, medium, medium, hard)
2. I'll solve them with time limits
3. Review each solution as if you're scoring it for <company>
4. Give specific feedback on code quality, efficiency, and presentation"
```

**Communication practice:**
```
"As I solve this problem, I'll explain my thinking out loud.
Interrupt me if my explanation is unclear or if I'm missing 
something an interviewer would want to hear."
```

## 7. **Knowledge Gap Analysis**

**Systematic improvement:**
```
"Based on my recent code samples, what are my top 3 technical weaknesses 
for a <company> interview? Create a 2-week study plan to address them."
```

**Concept deep-dives:**
```
"Explain [CONCEPT] with 3 coding problems of increasing difficulty.
After I solve each, show me how this concept appears in 
other problem variations."
```

## 8. **Optimal Daily Practice Routine**

**Structure your sessions:**

**Monday/Wednesday/Friday (45 minutes):**
```
"Give me today's practice session:
1. One problem from my weak areas
2. One <company>-style problem  
3. Review/optimize one of my previous solutions"
```

**Tuesday/Thursday (30 minutes):**
```
"Quick review session:
1. Explain one Go concept I should master
2. Give me a rapid-fire problem to practice speed
3. Quiz me on time/space complexity of common patterns"
```

## 9. **Advanced Optimization Techniques**

**Pattern recognition:**
```
"Here are 5 problems I solved this week: [LIST]
What patterns do they share? What template solution 
can I create for similar problems?"
```

**Meta-learning:**
```
"Analyze my problem-solving approach from these examples.
What's my typical methodology? How can I improve my 
systematic thinking for interviews?"
```

## 10. **Pre-Interview Final Prep**

**Day before interview:**
```
"Quick confidence builder: Give me 3 easy problems I can solve 
perfectly in 10 minutes each. Then quiz me on Go syntax 
and common edge cases I might forget under pressure."
```

**Morning of interview:**
```
"Mental warmup: One medium problem to get my brain ready.
Then remind me of the top 5 things to remember during 
the actual interview (communication, edge cases, etc.)"
```

## Pro Tips for Using Claude Effectively:

1. **Be specific** about your goals and timeline
2. **Share your thinking process**, not just final code
3. **Ask for alternatives** - never settle for one approach
4. **Request explanations** of why certain solutions are better
5. **Practice explaining** your code back to Claude
6. **Use Claude to simulate pressure** by setting time limits
7. **Get feedback on your communication style** during problem solving

## Sample Optimal Session:

```
"Claude, I have 45 minutes for interview prep. Here's what I want:

1. Give me a medium-difficulty problem similar to what <company> asks
2. I'll solve it and share my approach
3. You review it focusing on: code clarity, efficiency, Go idioms
4. Then show me 2 alternative approaches I should know
5. End with a quick quiz on the key concepts this problem tests

Ready? Start the timer!"
```

This approach turns Claude into your personal coding interview coach rather than just an answer provider. The key is active engagement and specific, targeted practice!
